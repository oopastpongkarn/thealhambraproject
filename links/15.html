	<p class="des">p4m: This group also has both order 2 and 4 rotations. This group has four axes of reflection. The axes of reflection are inclined to each other by 45° so that four axes of reflection pass through each order 4 rotation center. Every rotation center lies on some reflection axes. There are also two glide reflections passing through each order 2 rotation, with axes at 45° to the reflection axes. P4m is very common and is easy to recognize because of its square lattice.

		Walking through the Alhambra Palace is like walking into a giant book. Arabic calligraphy runs around the walls, ceilings, and columns. A slogan from the  Nasrid dynasty, who ruled Granada for two and a half centuries, “There is no victor but Allah” is the most common inscription. There are also poems, verses from the Qur’an, witty aphorisms and pious wishes.These images are scans made directly from the palace walls.
