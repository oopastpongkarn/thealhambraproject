		We are grateful to the wonderful artists whose contributions expanded our site intervention at the Alhambra Theater. Etel Adnan and Lynn exchanged emails while Lynn was at the Alhambra Palace. Language from their exchange resulted in a video poem installed in a gym alcove. Binta Ayofemi and Omar Mismar installed video works on existing gym monitors. Elaine Buckholtz’s searchlight illuminated the Alhambra Theater exterior. Pearl Marill developed the exercise class choreography.
