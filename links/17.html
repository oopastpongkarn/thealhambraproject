		The seventeen mathematical tessellation patterns that exist throughout the Alhambra Palace, copied in the gym, became one of the underlying structural principles of the project. We talked to seventeen people for the walking tour app, each of their portraits was turned into one of the wallpaper patterns, and exhibited as sheets of wallpaper at Backstage Hair salon as part of the Alhambra Project.

	<small>We had a conversation with Anysa Saleh about how to create sacred spaces in daily life. Anysa is a Bay Area artist who been exploring what it means to be a contemporary Muslim woman in the US, to wear a head scarf in public, to be harassed on the bus, defended by another person sitting next to her, to come from Yemen, but to have grown up in Bakersfield, California.

	<small>Carl Blake is a wonderful musician and Director of Music at the Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples on Larkin Street. Carl is classically trained, and you will hear his piano rendition of Claude Debussy’s <i>Gateway of the Alhambra Palace</i> on the web site. The inspiration for the piece came from a postcard sent to Debussy from the Spanish composer Manuel de Falla. The card depicted the Alhambra Gateway in Granada; Debussy never went in person.</small>

	<small> We came upon Doris Sloane’s book <i>Geology of the San Francisco Bay Region</i> and decided we had to have a conversation with her about the geology of Russian Hill — another history we could not see. We learned about Graywacke, a variety of hard sandstone, which is the main rock of Russian Hill. Doris is a wonderful explainer, having taught at UC Berkeley for many years. She told us about the processes and time frames of this slow geological evolution that transforms sedimentary rock into what we stand on, and helped us understand both the broader Bay Area landscape and the neighborhood.</small>

	<small>Fadi Berberi runs Smoke Signals, the magazine shop on Polk Street near Vallejo, where he has been for over twenty years. He started the shop as he missed the kind of kiosk/ newspaper stand that one finds in Europe, where he first went after leaving Lebanon. Fadi carries magazines from all over the world. He used to carry daily papers from everywhere as well, until the newspaper business changed in this digital age.</small>

	<small>Jeanette De Martini grew up on Green Street in the house next to Imogen Cunningham. Jeanette tells stories of Imogen and fig jam from back yard trees, going to school at St. Bridget’s down the street, and seeing films at the Alhambra Theater. Her family was part of a large Italian American community in the neighborhood. Gene De Martini told us about the Alhambra block — the fountain, the pharmacy, and the free plates that used to be given out at the movies. He also spoke of his days at Recology, and at Galileo high school where he was a football star. They still own the house on Green Street.</small>

	<small>Gunnar Anderson lives in the Julia Morgan building on Polk Street near Union. The building was originally owned by the woodcarver Jules Suppo who worked with Morgan at San Simeon. Suppo carved the ornate exterior of his own building. Gunnar is an architect himself — there have been many architects on Russian Hill, including Willis Polk, a relative of the president after whom the street was named. Gunnar showed us pictures of his sailboat and told us tales about sailing in the Bay. He left his native Norway after WWII to study architecture in New York, after graduation he moved to the Bay Area.</small>

	<small>We meet with Keyvan Shovir to talk to him about calligraphy. He was trained in classical calligraphy and pattern design in Iran before emigrating to the US. We have been interested in learning more about the history of pattern in both architecture and art throughout the Islamic world. He has melded his interest in sacred geometry and the street in his current work.</small>

	<small>Laura Marks is a media scholar. We came across her book <i>Enfoldment and Infinity: An Islamic Genealogy of New Media Art</i> and knew we had to have a conversation. Laura teachers at Simon Fraser University in Vancouver, so we Skyped. Laura sees the broader relationships between pattern in Islamic art, and contemporary work in the digital realm, and was helpful in making us think about the complexities of pattern, and immersive experience.</small>

	<small>Leesa Kozel and Paul Rosley live up on Green Street near the octagonal house. Paul grew up in the neighborhood and went to Russian Hill Preschool which used to be next door to Imogen’s/ Stephen’s house, in a little apartment. Graduation ceremonies and parties happened in the neighborhood, preschool at Ina Coolbrith Park, where butterflies were released, middle school celebratory lunches at restaurants on Polk Street, and often too in homes together, and always there was Swensen’s. Leesa and Paul are fun to be around.</small>

	<small>Michael Schneider teaches math at the California College of the Arts, but we met him first through his work <i>The Mathematical Archetypes of Nature, Art and Science</i>, and knew we had to be in conversation. Together, we took a walk in a park. Michael showed us the patterns all around us, the Fibonacci sequence in flowers, the mathematical relation of leaves to hands, and of course we discussed the seventeen repeatable tessellation patterns, the wallpaper patterns, in the Alhambra Palace.</small>

	<small>Quensella Miller lives on Van Ness and runs A Q Trip, a fun packed tour of hidden places and histories of San Francisco. Q is a San Francisco native, with deep routes in the city and knowledge of its history. We first ran into one another at William Cross win bar, a hang out for the neighborhood. When we met with Q she gave us her hidden tour of the neighborhood, including Shanghai Kelly’s on the corner of Polk and Broadway, an old Irish bar named after the practice of capturing drunks to man ships during the Gold Rush when entire crews left to prospect.</small>

	<small>Stephen Goldstine lives with his wife Emily Keeler, in what was Imogen Cunningham’s house on Green Street. He was her assistant as a young man.

	<small>Sue De Martini is Gene and Jeanette’s daughter and lives in the house on Green Street. A long time resident of the neighborhood she has watched it change over her lifetime; and indeed has seen the city transform. Sue has witnessed the scary, dramatic, and humorous sides of San Francisco, as one of the first wave of women firefighters; she was also a Bay swimmer for many years and introduced us to Cecile. When we walk together she knows everybody from swimming or firefighting, or from when the city was a smaller place, and neighborhoods less transient.</small>

	<small>Zach Zaltsman is the owner of Backstage. His former salon was in one of the lobby spaces at the front of the Alhambra Theater, where the old Alhambra soda fountain and candy shop was located. When the theater closed down and the interior was being dismantled to make way for the gym, Zach rescued two purple benches from the theater lobby. The benches now line the wall in his salon today. We talked to Zach about living and working in the neighborhood, and the changes he has seen since he arrived here from Ukraine after the disintegration of the Soviet Union more than twenty years ago.</small>
