	<small>One in a series of early project sketches. It features Carl Blake playing and discussing Claude Debussy’s La Puerta del Vino, a piano composition inspired by the Alhambra Palace in Spain. The golden tooth references Franks Norris’ 1899 novel, McTeague, about a vicious dentist on Polk Street. Erich von Stroheim based his 1924 film Greed on the book. The tooth still spins outside of a local bar.</small>

	<small>Long time Russian Hill resident Gene De Martini told stories of the changing neighborhood for the walking tour app. He also shared this film, shot and directed by his cousin, of the family scavenger business. He co-stars alongside his other cousin. Shot in the 1950’s in the alley behind the Alhambra Theater and around Polk Street, the film is a lovely historical document of the neighborhood.</small>
