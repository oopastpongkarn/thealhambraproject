	<h2><em>Lydia Mathews: </em></h2>

	<p>
		Walking as an art form and a mode of inquiry has emerged as its own discursive field, with artistic projects, curatorial ventures and multi-disciplinary publications dedicated to exploring this terrain. This course will focus on how to approach the practice
		of walking as a means of investigating issues at the heart of your specific studio or scholarly practice—while simultaneously gaining deeper insights into the complex social, political, and ecological dynamics within our local environment. This form
		of research is less focused on reading and writing (although there will be some of both) than it is on becoming increasingly aware of one’s body as a multi-sensory vehicle for discovering images, stories, materials and urban rhythms. Not only does
		walking the city sharpen perceptual and critical observation, but it can also lead to the development of broader social networks or resources for future collaborations/ projects. In a fast paced and technologically oriented city like ours, what compellıng
		narratıves—both internal and external-- are only avaılable to us when we move slowly, with an eye towards becoming increasingly ınformed about a place's hıstorıes and contemporary polıtıcal realıtıes?

	<h2>WALKING MEDITATION</h2>
	<br> Take my hand.&#8232;<br> We will walk.&#8232;<br> We will only walk.&#8232;<br> We will enjoy our walk&#8232;<br> without thinking of arriving anywhere.&#8232;<br> Walk peacefully.&#8232;<br> Walk happily.&#8232;<br> Our walk is a peace walk.&#8232;<br>    Our walk is a happiness walk.&#8232;&#8232;<br>
	<br> Then we learn&#8232;<br> that there is no peace walk;<br> &#8232;that peace is the walk;&#8232;<br> that there is no happiness walk;&#8232;<br> that happiness is the walk.&#8232;<br> We walk for ourselves.&#8232;<br> We walk for everyone<br>    &#8232;always hand in hand.&#8232;&#8232;<br>
	<br> Walk and touch peace every moment.&#8232;<br> Walk and touch happiness every moment.<br> &#8232;Each step brings a fresh breeze.&#8232;<br> Each step makes a flower bloom under our feet.<br> &#8232;Kiss the Earth with your feet.&#8232;<br> Print
	on Earth your love and happiness.<br> &#8232;&#8232;Earth will be safe&#8232;<br> when we feel in us enough safety.
