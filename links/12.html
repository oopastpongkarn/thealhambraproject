		Crunch Fitness, which runs the theater/gym on Polk Street, is headquartered in New York City. Initially the project was enthusiastically supported by Crunch corporate. Different managers came and went from the gym on Polk Street while we were working on the project. We never lost our commitment to this site, and we negotiated and cajoled until opening night. We are truly grateful for all the support from everybody at Crunch.
