        <p>Cities are a tangle of surprising elements layered over time. The density allows for surprising juxtapositions, like a couple arguing under a Happy Donuts sign or a nightclub next to a mortuary. Rebecca Solnit writes in her book <em>Infinite City</em>          that maps twenty two different San Franciscos, &ldquo;&hellip;no two people live in the same city&hellip;.If you pay attention to the neighbors, you find other worlds within them.&rdquo; Lynn Marie Kirby with her collaborator Christoph Steger
          have generously uncovered aspects of the many worlds coexisting within a few square blocks of Kirby&rsquo;s home in Russian Hill, with a focus on the old Alhambra Theater, now a Crunch Gym. </p>
        <p>So many related elements were brought into play in <em>The Alhambra Project</em>. First, passing through the lobby, video images of the actual Alhambra in Spain (filmed and edited by Kirby) were playing, acknowledging the link to the building&rsquo;s
          grand inspiration. Another screen showed as text a lively correspondence about the Spanish Alhambra between Kirby and the poet and visual artist Etel Adnan (who is now living in Paris)&mdash;for example, &ldquo;I wish we could see the moonlight
          over the Alhambra together.&rdquo; Their long distance friendship, not to mention Adnan&rsquo;s importance in the Bay Area poetry community, folded beautifully into the mix of elements in the installation, worlds within worlds like nesting Russian
          dolls. </p>
        <p>The building&rsquo;s former use and current use collided in the main space. Edited clips of old films once shown at the theater were projected onto the big screen, and below that, an exercise class led by an instructor who was calling out choreographed
          moves approximating the gestures of the actors on the screen. Rather than lamenting about the downgrade from palace to theater to gym, the whole scene was a celebration of co-existing worlds. Scattered around the enormous building people were
          on machines working out in the &ldquo;real time&rdquo; of the gym. Kirby and Steger made us aware of how dynamic a space can be, with all of us like actors temporarily moving through.</p>
        <p>Before heading home, we walked around the block to Swensen&rsquo;s to get our free ice cream cone (as part of the show's offering and mobile app neighborhood walk) and met the owner there, who was eager to talk about what was taking place at the
          Alhambra. I realized I was now in a new role as messenger and tried hard to describe all that was taking place. &ldquo;Is it a tour?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You could say that.&rdquo; Kirby and Steger have turned a neighborhood slightly askew
          so we can see it from a different angle, like the fresh eyes of tourists experiencing the complex layers of a place. <em>The Alhambra Project</em>, like Kirby&rsquo;s previous <em>Twenty-Fourth Street Listening Project,</em> is an imaginative
          work of civic engagement.</p>

        <p><em>The large picture houses in Berlin are palaces of distraction; to call them </em>movie theaters <em>(</em>Kinos<em>) would be disrespectful.</em></p>
        <p>Siegfried Kracauer, &ldquo;Cult of Distraction: On Berlin&rsquo;s Picture Palaces,&rdquo; 1926.</p>
        <p>The heyday of old movie palaces of the type of San Francisco&rsquo;s Moorish-revival style Alhambra Theater (Miller and Pflueger, 1926) ended with the coming of sound to motion pictures in the late 1920s. The introduction of the talkies led to
          a new building boom of theaters outfitted with sound equipment. Before this, films were only one part of elaborate multi-media programs that encompassed the entire space of the theater and included live music, dance performances, and the self-display
          of the patrons themselves. Movie palaces of the 1920s were multi-sensory, multi-media adult fantasy environments where consumers were invited to imagine access to the wealth of physical luxuries available, in the past, only to kings, queens,
          and the aristocracy. Visitors were invited to see and be seen; to perform new kinds of consumption-driven identities: &ldquo;The patron would be impressed, flabbergasted by the monumentality and luxury of the palace, moving through a real, tangible,
          and in this sense &lsquo;consumable,&rsquo; environment. The body, movements, and sensations were of central importance.&rdquo; The corporeal and performative nature of the movie palace experience set it apart from later film-going.</p>
        <p>In Lynn Marie Kirby and Christoph Steger&rsquo;s one-day 2016 multi-media extravaganza, <em>The Alhambra Project</em>, this kind of exhibition and reception fluidity was re-performed and updated in a decidedly digital, computer-art-based context.
          The event took place one fall evening at the site of the old Alhambra Theatre, now re-purposed as a gym. The Alhambra ceased operation as a movie theater in 1998, and was later converted to a gym by the Crunch Fitness corporation; the conversion
          retained most of the theater&rsquo;s interior detail, including the large ceiling medallion, the encrusted wall-mirrors, and the old movie screen. Cardio machines now face the screen and films are still shown, if only for gym members.</p>
        <p>On September 30<sup>th</sup>, 2016, after months of planning and preparation, Kirby and Steger invited the public into the Alhambra to experience an event that looked backward to the pasts of the theater in complex and evocative ways: back to
          the Moorish architectural revival style that, in California, replaced the Mission revival style and looked back beyond Mexico to Spain. The project looked back to the Islamic sacred-art underpinnings of both the Moorish revival style and of
          contemporary computer-based art. It also looked back to previous eras, still held in the living memories of its residents, of the ever-changing Russian Hill neighborhood where the Alhambra Theater is situated at 2330 Polk Street. The event was
          enriched and enlivened by contributions from collaborating artists from around the world: Etel Adnan, Omar Mismar, Binta Ayofemi, Pearl Marill, Emma Manion, and Elaine Buckholtz.</p>
        <p>While the old movie palace experience was not exclusively defined by the narrative aspects of film exhibition (the &lsquo;story&rsquo; of the film), the analogue projection of silent films &ndash; the stream of light onto the screen and the clatter
          of the mechanism &ndash; was certainly part of the corporeal experience of the theater. Kirby and Steger organized their event around many forms of relationship between the bodies of visitors and screen interfaces. The space around the large
          main screen in the theater was transformed into a dance floor where the public was invited to imitate exercise movements choreographed by dancer Pearl Marill and led by Emma Manion. These exercises reproduced movement-snippets taken from films
          screened at the Alhambra over its 60+ year-long-history as a movie theater. Each movement was transformed into a gif and described in an intertitle (&ldquo;move hands reveal face&rdquo;; &ldquo;move our arms&rdquo;; etc), accompanied by dramatic
          appropriated film music, and the whole loop of gifs was repeated every 15 or 20 minutes, so a new group of visitors could participate. Other uses of screens involved the creation of a mobile-app tour for personal cell-phone use outside in the
          environs of the theater and, lastly, taking over the gym&rsquo;s video monitors to present a cycle of 6 video works. Among these works were tours of the interior and exterior of the original Alhambra; footage of pets from the Russian Hill neighborhood;
          excerpts from an email conversation between Kirby and Etel Adnan; animated photographs of bodybuilders working out in the ruins of an unspecified city by Omar Mismar; and a video of a waterfall by Binta Ayofemi.</p>
        <p>A theme of water ran through many of the videos, especially the tours of the Alhambra, the conversations between Kirby and Adnan, and this last waterfall video. Certainly, and almost subliminally, the movement of water and the cascading of images
          one imagines in the old Alhambra theatre, in the current Alhambra&rsquo;s use as a gym, and in the one-night event of <em>The Alhambra Project </em>strike a resonant chord. For anyone who has visited the Alhambra palaces in Granada, Spain, the
          sounds of cool water flowing from the nearby Sierra Nevada Mountains and coursing through channels, fountains, and complex hydraulic systems to irrigate the gardens around the palaces; the movement of water that fills the many interior and exterior
          reflecting pools and provides a renewable refuge from often blistering heat: these sounds are overwhelmingly a primary acoustic take-away. In her video tours of the Alhambra palaces, Kirby sometimes aptly centered water-sounds as pure soundscape.
          On the gym monitors, sounds and images of water were often privileged, and this watery presence fully and almost uncannily reactivated, for knowing visitors, the original Alhambra experience. </p>
        <p>If movie palaces before talkies were distinctive in that the total corporeal and performative experience of these spaces was set apart from later modes of film reception, Laura U. Marks&rsquo; writings on Islamic philosophy and new media art suggest
          related points of connection between Islamic art, older modes of media reception in the West, and contemporary computer-based art of the type underlying <em>The Alhambra Project</em>. Kirby interviewed Marks for the project, and excerpts from
          this interview were incorporated into the third type of screen interface created for the event: the mobile app tour of the Russian Hill neighborhood around the Alhambra theater. In her interview, Marks notes: &ldquo;All religions require some
          kinds of performative acts&rdquo; and &ldquo;Islamic art &ndash; because of the prohibition against images &ndash; has this aspect of performativity.&rdquo; In her longer study, <em>Enfoldment and Infinity</em>, Marks observes that &ldquo;Islamic
          Art invites a kind of attention that is embodied, subjective, and performative. The body is important&hellip;not as something to be represented, but as a medium of reception&rdquo; (62). The Islamic concept of embodied subjective perception,
          where a &ldquo;multisensory aesthetics&rdquo; refers to &ldquo;the participation of fragrances, gustatory delicacies, fountains, music, and visual splendor,&rdquo; implies &ndash; according to Marks &ndash; a &ldquo;somewhat dispersed subjectivity&rdquo;
          (62).
        </p>
        <p>This kind of &ldquo;dispersed subjectivity&rdquo; can be an important pre-disposition to various states of expanded awareness and aesthetic and religious sensitivity. The suggestion has been made that it underlies the reception of contemporary
          interactive art as well. According to Arjen Mulder, interactive art may be &ldquo;valueless&rdquo; in itself, but it &ldquo;opens you up, rearranges you, helps you on your way, causes you to flow and divide.&rdquo; Kirby&rsquo;s projects have
          always stressed the importance of multi-sensory experience, and have used what is often narrowly conceived as primarily &lsquo;visual&rsquo; media &ndash; video, film, performance, digital arts &ndash; to stage expanded experiences that involve
          all the senses. Several of her projects are framed around hearing and listening: <em>The 24</em><em><sup>th</sup></em><em> Street Listening Project </em>(2012); <em>Roomtone </em>(2015); and others. Her recent Venice para-Biennale intervention
          at Campo Madonna De l&rsquo;Orto, <em>To Hold To Miss To Remember </em>(2017)<em>,</em> was framed around the proximate sense of smell: around sitting with strangers in a shared olfactory space where memory, kinship, and affect might be released
          and circulated. Facilitating or activating a &ldquo;dispersed subjectivity&rdquo; and an experience that &ldquo;opens you up, rearranges you, helps you on your way, causes you to flow and divide&rdquo; have been at the heart of Kirby&rsquo;s
          body of work for many years.</p>
        <p>According to Marks, unlike the forms of aniconism peculiar to Islamic art, computer-based art is often &ldquo;less responsive to the nuances of subjectivity, for it reduces our spectrum of engagement to a few variables&rdquo; (62). Such a reduction
          of variables does not apply, exactly, in the case of Steger and Kirby&rsquo;s <em>Alhambra Project</em>, since it was staged in large part in real time and real space, and since it activated a kind of &ldquo;performativity&rdquo; that film historians
          attribute specifically to movie palaces of the 1920s. Marks makes comparisons between the aniconic and algorithmic underpinnings of new media art and Islamic art with careful attention to both their similarities and their differences. Islamic
          art is material and sensuous and invites embodied engagement: &ldquo;This is what it has in common with the Western modern art that in part it inspired. New media art is trying to restore a sense of the body to its dry spaces of calculation&hellip;but
          it remains a challenge&rdquo; (65).</p>
        <p>Marks suggests that &ldquo;an Islamic approach&rdquo; to new media art might &ldquo;help us to think about how new media could cultivate subjective but impersonal attitudes&hellip; It might also help us think about which virtualities are really
          worth struggling for&rdquo; (65). <em>The Alhambra Project</em> took up this challenge to find and to maximize an &ldquo;Islamic approach&rdquo; to new media art that might foster new attitudes, new communities, and new subject-positions; and
          that might also honor and value those of the past. Ultimately, Marks argues that Islamic art, like computer-based art, works by unfolding-enfolding principles that are importantly about communication, performativity, access to the invisible,
          and creating social interaction. In Islam, the aim is to generate social networks, along with attitudes of reverence toward the invisible, the infinite, Allah, God. Steger and Kirby&rsquo;s project generated decidedly secular -- but nonetheless
          movingly (and whimsically) felt -- networks of connection between the participants and the site of the performance-event. Through maps of the neighborhood, through the mobile phone app, and simply by bringing people together in and around the
          theater, Steger and Kirby linked participants to businesses, residents, visitors to the neighborhood, and to each other.</p>
        <p>Arriving the evening of the Alhambra event, we &ndash; my friends and I &ndash; spent the evening first trying out (or just watching) the choreographed exercises. Then we checked out the monitors, and were at first somewhat mystified by images
          of male bodies posing and flexing amid debris in an apparently devastated city. We tried to make sense of the virtual &ndash; but cut-up &ndash; tour of the &lsquo;real&rsquo; Alhambra. Then we sought refuge in a quiet eddy off to the side where
          a monitor ran text from an email exchange between Kirby and Lebanese-French artist Etel Adnan -- mainly concerning the waters of the Alhambra. The text was superimposed on, or alternated with, color fields of blue. Then we followed the maps
          on handouts that directed us toward various neighborhood businesses that had been recruited to participate in the project. We were intrigued by the idea of a local hair salon (Backstage Hair Salon) that was hosting a display of large-scale images:
          a &ldquo;Wallpaper Pattern Exhibition.&rdquo; But when we reached the salon door, it was locked tight with a steel security gate. They&rsquo;d closed early. So we strolled back up the street to a participating wine-bar (William Cross Wine Bar)
          that was offering free tastes of a Spanish Cava along with cheese and crackers. While there, we spontaneously struck up a conversation with another local artist, who invited us to her own event a few weeks away. New connections to the city and
          its residents were generated &ndash; and we did in fact eventually attend this other future event, outdoors in the Presidio &ndash; where a new network, and a new space in the city, unfolded for us. </p>
        <p>After the wine bar, we tried out the mobile app walking tour, but by then it was too dark and too cold to venture further, so we saved it for another day. While Steger and Kirby&rsquo;s event was light-hearted and fun (a Kirby trade-mark), it
          also partook of some serious, if lightly held, pedagogical aims that sunk in and gained traction and depth over time. We learned something about the Alhambra (the movie palace and the Moorish-Christian palaces); we learned about an underlying
          set of connections between California and Spain; and we learned something deeper about connections between Islamic art and computer-based performative &lsquo;event&rsquo; art. We also learned about the neighborhood and some of the people who
          live there. New social networks unfolded, and existing ones were reinforced, with an overall feeling I can only describe as certainly &ldquo;embodied&rdquo;; also &ldquo;performative&rdquo;; but, as well, kindly, playful, loving, and community-building:
          an ethical feeling, in other words, that I associate with the sacred, however we define it.</p>

        <h2>Letter to a Daughter/Emily Keeler</h2>
        <p>I have seen these hills we still walk with your hand holding my pointy- finger, as we look both ways at the corners, practicing crossing.</p>
        <p>We have walked these streets in stony silences and easy chatter, running into the Bungalow&rsquo;s, and the Heresy&rsquo;s, Toni and her granddad, Valerie and her son, then her daughter, people who remember you and the people you remember. </p>
        <p>We ran down the hill for a video, and up the hill and through the short cut to Remy&rsquo;s. We walked up then way down Leavenworth to the new park, up then down Larkin to Helen Wills Park, up then right on Hyde to the Tee- Pee park and left turn
          for ice cream. And down Hyde from Swenson&rsquo;s&mdash;ZA Pizza where Bill Clinton became the president in front of us right there at the counter on the high stools. </p>
        <p>Down Union from Swenson&rsquo;s is the corner where I met your bus when you came home the day after Columbine because Joey had brought a gun to school. </p>
        <p>We walked and walked&mdash;up and down our hills the day the towers came down on the television and we couldn&rsquo;t watch it anymore. It was quiet in the streets and we walked all the way to St. Peter and Paul, to the park. It was quiet there
          too. People were sitting in the sun, because there <em>was</em> sun that day in the early fall.</p>
        <p>We used to go through the garden and then have to look for our car on these hills. Do you remember the days when the car wouldn&rsquo;t start or when we couldn&rsquo;t find it at all?</p>
        <p>I would call after you as you walked through the garden to the street not to forget your lunch, not to forget your books, your watch, your pills, your project, the one you made with your father&mdash;the project for the science fair about colored
          light. </p>
        <p>We walked down the hill to Lynn and Steve&rsquo;s with a bottle of wine, with flowers, <em>here you carry them</em>, with candy, with books, with scarves for her birthday, with music for his. The dog still stops in front of their door on his walks.
          Keep going their way and you hit the water and the pier where we looked back and saw our hills pouring down to the water. How many times have we walked on that pier together?</p>
        <p>We walked up Polk Street to the earring store and the Jug Shop, oh and the flower store we loved so much, <em>look they&rsquo;ve painted the floor to look like stones!</em> with the mirrors and vases and toys from Mexico and India. Your father
          said they didn&rsquo;t pay their taxes even though they were daughters of society people and they went out of business.</p>
        <p>And Merry&rsquo;s of course, that nail polish smell as we walked by or walked in. Her smart daughter got into Lowell then Cal, in those days she not old enough to run the credit cards. We used to see her&mdash;a&nbsp; little Vietnamese girl with
          a big head eating shyly in the corner with a book broken open on her knee.</p>
        <p>We&rsquo;ve walked down our street and to the left and left again to go to the Palestinian&rsquo;s store, before their deli, before their liquor license, when it was the first way without all of the nice refrigerators, remember? And before the
          Palestinian&rsquo;s we went almost every day to Polk Vallejo Grocery just a block up. Remember that family? Big Debbie and her dad? And the nice butchers? We would walk up the hill with a BBQ chicken in a bag fragrant and hot. That would be
          our dinner on those nights all of us home from exciting things, and hard things, and you having hours more at your little desk, which looked out over the porch then. It is the same window in our kitchen, now, but different because of the wall
          being gone. But you could see the streetlight that is still there, lighting Green Street and our garden.</p>
        <p>We also got our dinner from the pasta shop on Larkin where we met Linda for the very first time. It was where the apartment service is now. It&rsquo;s gone and so is the caf&eacute; where you learned to walk on Hyde, where the Italian restaurant
          is now. We all sat there and watched you little ones first crawl then stagger around like miniature drunks, hanging on the tables and chairs and the odd hand. </p>
        <p>Also gone is the pharmacy with the mosaic entrance, to the left of the caf&eacute;, on the corner of Union, where there was the weird gift shop and now the yoga studio. We filled prescriptions there, and bought our hand lotions, and aspirin, before
          Walgreen&rsquo;s. It smelled of powders and pills, warmed from the sun through its wide windows. We used that other dry cleaners for daddy&rsquo;s suits up the street, then, on Hyde. They never got the clothes quite clean but they gave you those
          tins of cookies for Christmas, remember? And the Heresy&rsquo;s in those days lived a half a block away. Valerie made deserts, and we sat on the floor with you two girls, because they had no chairs. And then their second baby came. Do you remember
          their bird flying out of the back of their car as they packed to leave these streets behind?</p>
        <p>And the gift shop and all the little dress shops, those are new and have changed these streets. So have the way the bars have become. They were quiet but now there parties that have erupted in them. Do you remember it the other way? Before Polker&rsquo;s
          was crammed with young couples after a night of drinking and getting to know you sex. Before the yogurt stores, even before Nick&rsquo;s Crispy Tacos. </p>
        <p>In the winter when it is clear, at night we always look into people&rsquo;s apartments when we walk on Vallejo. We can look across the street and see into their lives, lit. It is the same on Larkin, where it&rsquo;s fancy and flat. On those blocks,
          which I know you like, there are brass knockers and kick plates, pretty metal gates, lacquered red doors, and nicely cared for little gardens. That has always been the same or it seems like that.</p>
        <p>We won&rsquo;t run into Dennis anymore. Or Linda. We can&rsquo;t look at the cards in Jade Snow Wong up Polk where there is a dress shop now. Bonnie&rsquo;s nursery has left. (<em>You</em> were in that sandbox down our back stairs; <em>you</em>          were through the garden in the morning to the right and up the steep stairs to its door. <em>Your</em> face was one of those children in the window looking into our dark garden with spaghetti on your plate or a scissors in your hand.)</p>
        <p>Remember walking at dusk to Helen Wills Park when you were at Bonnie&rsquo;s? Do you remember the races you run round that park before it became pretty and new? When it still had the dirty sand and the dark little building? The helping parents
          stood in the special place while you children ran the circle of the park and high- fived us at the finish line. <em>Good job! </em>as you polished off another day. Then we all joined hands, the helpers, the parents and the children and walked
          out of the park and waited for the long light on Broadway to turn. But we weren&rsquo;t impatient at the light. We had all the time in the world to get home.</p>
