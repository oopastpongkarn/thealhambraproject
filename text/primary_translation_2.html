	<h2>Beyond Divisive Boundaries</h2>
	<p>Rev. Dr. Dorsey Blake</p>


	<p>When I was first told about and asked to participate in <i>the Alhambra Project</i>, my mind and spirit journeyed back to a critical and often forgotten time in the world. The Alhambra Palace played a significant role in Granada, Andalusia, Spain. Under
		Moorish leadership, it promoted interfaith acceptance and harmony, providing support for Muslims, Christians, and Jews. In the year 2000, I was a member of an interfaith delegation on a pilgrimage to neighboring Morocco to ascertain what message there
		might be for us with our contemporary challenges in living together. Remembering this legacy has been source of great strength as I contemplate how to move our nation ahead presently. The rekindling of this heritage indelibly imprints upon my consciousness
		that interfaith respect and cooperation have existed before and are possible and critical for a vital society today.
	</p>
	<p>As the Presiding Minister of the Church for The Fellowship of All Peoples, the nation’s first interracial, interfaith congregation, I was fascinated by the rediscovery. My entire years of ministry have been committed to going beyond boundaries that too
		often divide, leading to misunderstanding and even hatred. Beyond divisive boundaries, if we wholeheartedly seek it, there is common ground.
	</p>
	<p>
		The evening of September 30, 2016, is indelibly etched in my memory. In the afternoon children from the neighborhood stopped by the church’s location at 2041 Larkin Street for a pattern drawing and ice cream social event. They learned about the history
		of the Alhambra while coloring patterns based on tile design in the palace. Children have always been a special interest of our ministry. During the 1940’s and early 1950’s, the Fellowship Church annually sponsored international children workshops during
		the summers where children learned about the various peoples of the world through sharing food from those nations and hearing stories from people wearing the native clothes of the nation being discussed.
	</p>
	<p>
		During the remainder of the evening I was enthralled by the vision and artistry of Lynn Marie Kirby and Christoph Steger. What I experienced were times and places, people and accomplishments that were once vibrant participants in the life of the Russian
		Hills community. Although much of it no longer exists except in the legacy of the present, the experience revealed that there is much that lends itself to renewal, to finding common ground again. Communicating with the past, I became more cognizant
		of the challenges and opportunities before us today.
	</p>
	<p>
		Underdressed for San Francisco weather, I began my sojourn through this community, a community of which I had been a participant for twenty-five years, but without the same intimacy. The first stop on this journey was a business I had not noticed before:
		Backstage Salon. Although my hair might have needed something done to it, this was not the purpose of the stop. Kirby and Steger opened an exhibition of large color prints featuring portraits of participants. Each portrait had been repeated as a tessellated
		pattern and printed onto long sheets of wallpaper since mathematicians refer to the 17 different geometrical patterns found in the Alhambra as <i>the wallpaper patterns</i>. Stephen Goldstine, a member of our church, Dr. Carl Blake, the church’s Director
		of Music, and I were among the participants. The strategically mounted patterns around the salon caught my attention and were fascinating. It was not my best photo; but, I can’t seem to find a best one. I knew that I was in the right place when greeted
		by Christoph as Stephen Goldstine exited the shop on his way to experience more of the alluring evening.
	</p>
	<p>
		As I approached the site of Crunch gym, a sadness emerged, a sadness that I had never visited the site when it was the Alhambra theatre in its full majesty as a theatre. What a magnificent architectural achievement. How inviting it was even in its present
		manifestation. I did not stay long at the theater for this night of dazzling video interventions and performances and didn’t exercise either. I did hear my brother’s exquisite piano music in the background and applauded inwardly those who were concerned
		about their personal, embodied palaces by exercising.
	</p>
	<p>
		I met two young men there who were brothers. How gracious and helpful they were! I was having difficulty downloading the app for this climatic visit through the neighborhood. Eventually, one of them and I shared ear plugs, one in one of his ears and one
		in one of mine. Off we went for our mobile app powered tour of the multidisciplinary archive of the neighborhood, audio and visual conversations with residents and others, including artists from around the globe. The tour was also supported with animation
		and additional interactive experiences at 17 varied stations. Places, events and people of which and of whom I had no prior knowledge were now my teachers. I learned of how imagination found forms in ways that made me “behold” the sacred in its varied
		manifestations as we walked.
	</p>
	<p>
		Eventually, the young man and I had to switch ears or was it, switch earplugs. We walked the entire tour together. He would have been the age of a son if I had one, or perhaps more honestly a grandson, if I had one. Being tethered to this young man was
		a slight challenge and a great joy. <i>The Alhambra Project</i> brought us together across racial and generational lines. It punctuated the event and night while lifting my spirit with gratitude for a brief journey with a new companion of life. Names
		didn’t matter. Hearts did. Minds did. Steps in sync did. Comradeship did. Indeed, during this time, our interplayed and souls mingled, demonstrating that when the sublime caresses the common place and people from diverse backgrounds share the experience
		profoundly, sublimity reigns. A voice assures me that walking together with others can become a habit of the heart, solidifying us soul brothers and sisters.
	</p>
	<p>
		The narratives shared about the past are also narratives about our present time and our personal lives. What do they say to all those who participated? What do they say about us and our future? What images were evoked by them? What horizons did we envisage?
		What did they mirror? Did they cause us to become more acquainted with ourselves? What did they cause us to call forth? Did they cause us to act differently? Did the death of past activities resurrect anything in us, in our relationship to each other
		and to the times in which we live? Were the words spoken, the music heard, the images projected received well enough in the depths of our being that we may become harbingers of future words, sights, images and music that might redeem our times and advocate
		a world of harmony in which it all comes together and works for all?
	</p>
	<p>
		Dr. Howard Thurman, one of our church’s co-founding ministers stated:
	</p>
	<p><i>What we have sought we have found, our own sense of identity. We have an established center out of which at last we can function and relate to others [men].  We have committed to heart and to nervous system a feeling of belonging and our spirits are no longer isolated and afraid.  We have lost our fear of our brothers and sisters and are no longer ashamed of ourselves, of who and what we are –Let us now go forth to save the land of our birth from the plague that first drove us into the “will to quarantine” and separate ourselves behind self-imposed walls.  For this is why we were born: Men [people], all men belong to each other, and he who shuts himself away diminishes himself, and he who shuts another away from him destroys himself.  And all the people said <b>Amen</b>.</i>
	</p>
	<p>The mystical and community building presence of the evening was clearly unique and inspiring. Out of my daily routine I experienced a different time and place, although both the time and place were familiar. Yes, that’s it, the familiar took on a sheen
		and glory that made me pay attention and give appreciation.
	</p>
	<p>The genius of The Alhambra Project was bringing together people, places, events, experiences through multimedia variations on a theme, with each variation having its own vitality and integrity, opening into and supporting the multifaceted composition
		of life, like the various movements of a grand symphony. I felt like an adventurer who discovered treasure in unknown yet familiar territory. Yes, September 30 was an evening of discovery, awakening, and renewal. This neighborhood wide installation
		was the culmination of over two years of research. I extend my unending gratitude to Lynn and Christoph for their vision, perseverance, and creative artistry in designing and implementing this magnificent gift to the community. It is a gift that shall
		keep on giving!</p>
