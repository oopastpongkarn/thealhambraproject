	<h2>Letter to a Daughter</h2>
	<p>Emily Keeler</p>

	<p>I have seen these hills we still walk with your hand holding my pointy- finger, as we look both ways at the corners, practicing crossing.</p>
	<p>We have walked these streets in stony silences and easy chatter, running into the Bungalow&rsquo;s, and the Heresy&rsquo;s, Toni and her granddad, Valerie and her son, then her daughter, people who remember you and the people you remember. </p>
	<p>We ran down the hill for a video, and up the hill and through the short cut to Remy&rsquo;s. We walked up then way down Leavenworth to the new park, up then down Larkin to Helen Wills Park, up then right on Hyde to the Tee- Pee park and left turn for ice cream. And down Hyde from Swenson&rsquo;s&mdash;ZA Pizza where Bill Clinton became the president in front of us right there at the counter on the high stools. </p>
	<p>Down Union from Swenson&rsquo;s is the corner where I met your bus when you came home the day after Columbine because Joey had brought a gun to school. </p>
	<p>We walked and walked&mdash;up and down our hills the day the towers came down on the television and we couldn&rsquo;t watch it anymore. It was quiet in the streets and we walked all the way to St. Peter and Paul, to the park. It was quiet there too. People were sitting in the sun, because there <em>was</em> sun that day in the early fall.</p>
	<p>We used to go through the garden and then have to look for our car on these hills. Do you remember the days when the car wouldn&rsquo;t start or when we couldn&rsquo;t find it at all?</p>
	<p>I would call after you as you walked through the garden to the street not to forget your lunch, not to forget your books, your watch, your pills, your project, the one you made with your father&mdash;the project for the science fair about colored light. </p>
	<p>We walked down the hill to Lynn and Steve&rsquo;s with a bottle of wine, with flowers, <em>here you carry them</em>, with candy, with books, with scarves for her birthday, with music for his. The dog still stops in front of their door on his walks. Keep going their way and you hit the water and the pier where we looked back and saw our hills pouring down to the water. How many times have we walked on that pier together?</p>
	<p>We walked up Polk Street to the earring store and the Jug Shop, oh and the flower store we loved so much, <em>look they&rsquo;ve painted the floor to look like stones!</em> with the mirrors and vases and toys from Mexico and India. Your father said they didn&rsquo;t pay their taxes even though they were daughters of society people and they went out of business.</p>
	<p>And Merry&rsquo;s of course, that nail polish smell as we walked by or walked in. Her smart daughter got into Lowell then Cal, in those days she not old enough to run the credit cards. We used to see her&mdash;a&nbsp; little Vietnamese girl with a big head eating shyly in the corner with a book broken open on her knee.</p>
	<p>We&rsquo;ve walked down our street and to the left and left again to go to the Palestinian&rsquo;s store, before their deli, before their liquor license, when it was the first way without all of the nice refrigerators, remember? And before the Palestinian&rsquo;s we went almost every day to Polk Vallejo Grocery just a block up. Remember that family? Big Debbie and her dad? And the nice butchers? We would walk up the hill with a BBQ chicken in a bag fragrant and hot. That would be our dinner on those nights all of us home from exciting things, and hard things, and you having hours more at your little desk, which looked out over the porch then. It is the same window in our kitchen, now, but different because of the wall being gone. But you could see the streetlight that is still there, lighting Green Street and our garden.</p>
	<p>We also got our dinner from the pasta shop on Larkin where we met Linda for the very first time. It was where the apartment service is now. It&rsquo;s gone and so is the caf&eacute; where you learned to walk on Hyde, where the Italian restaurant is now. We all sat there and watched you little ones first crawl then stagger around like miniature drunks, hanging on the tables and chairs and the odd hand. </p>
	<p>Also gone is the pharmacy with the mosaic entrance, to the left of the caf&eacute;, on the corner of Union, where there was the weird gift shop and now the yoga studio. We filled prescriptions there, and bought our hand lotions, and aspirin, before Walgreen&rsquo;s. It smelled of powders and pills, warmed from the sun through its wide windows. We used that other dry cleaners for daddy&rsquo;s suits up the street, then, on Hyde. They never got the clothes quite clean but they gave you those tins of cookies for Christmas, remember? And the Heresy&rsquo;s in those days lived a half a block away. Valerie made deserts, and we sat on the floor with you two girls, because they had no chairs. And then their second baby came. Do you remember their bird flying out of the back of their car as they packed to leave these streets behind?</p>
	<p>And the gift shop and all the little dress shops, those are new and have changed these streets. So have the way the bars have become. They were quiet but now there parties that have erupted in them. Do you remember it the other way? Before Polker&rsquo;s was crammed with young couples after a night of drinking and getting to know you sex. Before the yogurt stores, even before Nick&rsquo;s Crispy Tacos. </p>
	<p>In the winter when it is clear, at night we always look into people&rsquo;s apartments when we walk on Vallejo. We can look across the street and see into their lives, lit. It is the same on Larkin, where it&rsquo;s fancy and flat. On those blocks, which I know you like, there are brass knockers and kick plates, pretty metal gates, lacquered red doors, and nicely cared for little gardens. That has always been the same or it seems like that.</p>
	<p>We won&rsquo;t run into Dennis anymore. Or Linda. We can&rsquo;t look at the cards in Jade Snow Wong up Polk where there is a dress shop now. Bonnie&rsquo;s nursery has left. (<em>You</em> were in that sandbox down our back stairs; <em>you</em> were through the garden in the morning to the right and up the steep stairs to its door. <em>Your</em> face was one of those children in the window looking into our dark garden with spaghetti on your plate or a scissors in your hand.)</p>
	<p>Remember walking at dusk to Helen Wills Park when you were at Bonnie&rsquo;s? Do you remember the races you run round that park before it became pretty and new? When it still had the dirty sand and the dark little building? The helping parents stood in the special place while you children ran the circle of the park and high- fived us at the finish line. <em>Good job! </em>as you polished off another day. Then we all joined hands, the helpers, the parents and the children and walked out of the park and waited for the long light on Broadway to turn. But we weren&rsquo;t impatient at the light. We had all the time in the world to get home.</p>
