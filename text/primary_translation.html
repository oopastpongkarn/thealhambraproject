	<h2>Worlds within Worlds</h2>
	<p>Denise Newman</p>

	<p>Cities are a tangle of surprising elements layered over time. The density allows for surprising juxtapositions, like a couple arguing under a Happy Donuts sign or a nightclub next to a mortuary. Rebecca Solnit writes in her book <em>Infinite City</em> that maps twenty two different San Franciscos, &ldquo;&hellip;no two people live in the same city&hellip;.If you pay attention to the neighbors, you find other worlds within them.&rdquo; Lynn Marie Kirby with her collaborator Christoph Steger have generously
		uncovered aspects of the many worlds coexisting within a few square blocks of Kirby&rsquo;s home in Russian Hill, with a focus on the old Alhambra Theater, now a Crunch Gym. </p>
	<p>So many related elements were brought into play in <em>The Alhambra Project</em>. First, passing through the lobby, video images of the actual Alhambra in Spain (filmed and edited by Kirby) were playing, acknowledging the link to the building&rsquo;s
		grand inspiration. Another screen showed as text a lively correspondence about the Spanish Alhambra between Kirby and the poet and visual artist Etel Adnan (who is now living in Paris)&mdash;for example, &ldquo;I wish we could see the moonlight over
		the Alhambra together.&rdquo; Their long distance friendship, not to mention Adnan&rsquo;s importance in the Bay Area poetry community, folded beautifully into the mix of elements in the installation, worlds within worlds like nesting Russian dolls.
		</p>
	<p>The building&rsquo;s former use and current use collided in the main space. Edited clips of old films once shown at the theater were projected onto the big screen, and below that, an exercise class led by an instructor who was calling out choreographed
		moves approximating the gestures of the actors on the screen. Rather than lamenting about the downgrade from palace to theater to gym, the whole scene was a celebration of co-existing worlds. Scattered around the enormous building people were on machines
		working out in the &ldquo;real time&rdquo; of the gym. Kirby and Steger made us aware of how dynamic a space can be, with all of us like actors temporarily moving through.</p>
	<p>Before heading home, we walked around the block to Swensen&rsquo;s to get our free ice cream cone (as part of the show's offering and mobile app neighborhood walk) and met the owner there, who was eager to talk about what was taking place at the Alhambra.
		I realized I was now in a new role as messenger and tried hard to describe all that was taking place. &ldquo;Is it a tour?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;You could say that.&rdquo; Kirby and Steger have turned a neighborhood slightly askew so we can see it
		from a different angle, like the fresh eyes of tourists experiencing the complex layers of a place. <em>The Alhambra Project</em>, like Kirby&rsquo;s previous <em>Twenty-Fourth Street Listening Project,</em> is an imaginative work of civic engagement.</p>
