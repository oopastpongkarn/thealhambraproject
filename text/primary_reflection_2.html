	<h2>Reflections on <i>The Alhambra Project</h2>
	<p>Sr. Marianne Farina, CSC</p>


	<p>Entering into the space of the Alhambra Project in the neighborhood of Polk Street in Russian Hill and the former theatre, named “Alhambra,” brought back powerful memories of personal encounters with people from different cultures and religions. These
		memories pointed to ways that I have been taught to value interreligious and intercultural dialogue and friendship.
	</p>
	<p>
		As a young girl growing up in the Bronx Borough of NYC in the late 1950’s an early understanding of the meaning of neighbor began with the experience of gum being gently removed from my hair by the mother of a boy who stuck it there. My playmate’s mother
		did her best to get as much of the gum out. Finally the father stepped in and began cutting my hair and styling it in order to cover up the damage. Eventually, the boy’s parents escorted me back to my apartment. When the door opened, and my mother invited
		all three of us in, her expression was one of surprise and amusement. She was startled to see the new hairdo but also charmed by the tale of the effort to remove the gum. As I left the foyer, I heard my mother thanking the parents for their good care
		of me.
	</p>
	<p>
		In recalling this incident, I also remembered how my parents showed genuine affection for all the people of our apartment complex, which included Hispanic, Black, Jewish, as well as Italian Catholic families like my own. I felt comfortable in the homes
		of these neighbors. From childhood, I was learning that the gift of love we shared in our home had a mission, to share it with those we called “neighbor.”
	</p>
	<p>
		I have wonderful memories of my home filled with neighborhood and workplace friends of different faiths and ethnicities. Around our table, over food and drink, we all shared our stories. This table was also the setting for my initial encounters with political
		debates. Diversity of opinion and belief were never an obstacle to learning, and conversation fostered an appreciation for different approaches. The values communicated in these exchanges were openness to others and their ideas, critical thinking, and,
		most importantly, friendship. Throughout the years of my youth, more than my formal education, it was the meeting of people from various cultures and religions around our ever-expandable dining room table that taught me life’s most profound lessons.
	</p>
	<p>

		In 1976 I joined the <i>Congregation of the Sisters of the Holy Cross</i>. I was inspired by the mission of Holy Cross to be witnesses to God’s desire for the transformation of human hearts and human relationships. Taking the model of Mary, Compassionate
		Mother, standing at the foot of the Cross of Christ, the Holy Cross Sisters seek to be present to our fellow human beings, especially to those who suffer. Our founder, Blessed Basil Anthony Mary Moreau, taught that compassion emerges from a spirit of
		union with God and one another (Vine and Branches, John 15), and that our religious communities should be places of friendship. These friendships extend to others as we enter into a dialogue of life characterized by a type of “border crossing” that
		traverses personal preferences, cultures, religions and economic distinctions, in order to form community with all people. Relationships are the foundation for the collaborative endeavors of the Holy Cross congregation in the fields of education, social
		work, and health care, as well as in projects focused on addressing social justice concerns.
	</p>
	<p>

		One of my greatest experiences as a Sister of the Holy Cross was living in Bangladesh from 1983 until 1994. As I sat on mud porches drinking tea with the villagers of the Tungail District, I came to realize how our conversations were spiritual adventures
		that led to meaningful collaborations and long-lasting friendships. We gathered often to plan for village projects, and to address communal problems. In this sharing, we connected to one another’s story. In debating possible plans, we — Christians,
		Muslims, Hindus, and tribal community members — revealed our sacred truths to one another. We came to appreciate the beliefs and values that each person held. These exchanges generated new insights about God, ourselves, and one another. Forming new
		patterns of thinking and greater respect for our common life, we continued to deepen our friendships; grasping more completely the meaning of being neighbor—global neighbors—who share the same truth that God created us EACH in God’s Image.

	<blockquote><address><b>“In passing over to other lives, one is led to turn the truth of one’s own life into poetry. This is especially clear when one comes to the point of saying to oneself “You are what (hu)man is” and “You are what God is.” The poetry here is not a falsification of the truth; it embodies rather deeper insight into the truth. Passing over to other lives changes one’s understanding of what (hu)man is and who God is.”</b>

	<p>The Alhambra Project with its various dimensions was a “border crossing” experience. People from different walks of life, cultures, religions, and ages, participated in activities that intersected diverse environments. The walking tour, videos of the
		neighborhood, exhibition in a hair salon, exercise classes, and the children’s afternoon program , served as sites of encounters — meeting points in which to create the poetry of being neighbor in the Polk Street environment. Though the formal project
		has ended, I believe the poetry-making continues.</p>
