  <p>A site intervention by <a href=""> Lynn Marie Kirby </a> and <a href="">Christoph Steger</a> at the former Alhambra Theater on Polk Street in San Francisco, opened on Friday, September 30, 2016.
    The Alhambra Project began as a neighborhood-wide installation based around the former Alhambra Theater, now a Crunch Gym, in San Francisco’s Russian Hill. The theater, designed by Timothy Pflueger in 1926 as a movie palace, was inspired by the original Alhambra Palace in Granada, Spain—an architectural wonder of the Moorish empire and a testament to the coexistence of Muslim, Jewish, and Christian traditions in Europe.

    The project took over the gym as a site for intervention and collaboration with neighborhood residents and artists around the world. On the gym floor, the public was invited to participate in a series of performative exercise classes based on movements isolated from films screened at the Alhambra during its years as an operational movie theatre. The exercise class was choreographed by dancer <em>Pearl Marill</em>, and run by <em>Emma Manion</em>.
    <br>
    A freely accessible mobile web app, coded by <em>Sam Elie</em>, guided visitors around a short loop of the neighborhood. 17 geo­tagged locations offered music, animations, and conversations with Russian Hill residents, merchants, artists, and scholars. The tour also stopped at local sponsors, including <em>My Nails</em> on Green Street for Alhambra inspired manicures, <em>William Cross Wine Bar</em> for a taste of Spanish cava and at <em>Swensen’s</em> for ice cream!
    <br>
    Kirby and Steger took over the gym’s monitors with a cycle of video works. The installation included video tours of both the interior and exterior of the original Alhambra Palace in Spain, footage of local pets, and a text piece by artist and poet <em>Etel Adnan</em> in conversation with Kirby.

    <em>Omar Mismar</em> examined bodybuilders working out in ruins instead of gyms and <em>Binta Ayofemi</em> presented a video of a waterfall. Interspersed throughout this cycle were animations by Steger based on the 17 possible kinds of infinitely repeatable patterns found in the original Alhambra palace and music by <em>Carl Blake</em> and composer <em>Mamoru Fujieda</em>. On the street outside the theater, artist <em>Elaine Buckholtz</em> presented a searchlight work.
    <br>
    In addition to the event at the theater, <em>The Church for the Fellowship of All Peoples</em> hosted an Alhambra pattern drawing class and ice cream social for children and parents.
    <br>
    An exhibition at <em>Backstage Salon</em> of large color prints featured portraits of project participants incorporated into one of the 17 tessellated mathematical patterns from the Alhambra Palace.
